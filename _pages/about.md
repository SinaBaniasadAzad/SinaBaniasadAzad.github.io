My research interests include Deep Learning in particular, and Machine Learning in general, with applications in Navigation, and Computer Vision. I am intended to better understand these methods in a principled manner by investigating their underlying mathematics and their practical implications in real life. My research goal is to channel such better theoretical and functional understanding of these new methods towards better practical solutions for real life problems.

## Research Interests

- Machine Learning
- Computer Vision
- Navigation
- Autonomous Driving

## Education

- M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering, Iran University of Science and Technology, (2021 - 2023)
- B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering, Shahid Beheshti University, (2017 - 2021)
